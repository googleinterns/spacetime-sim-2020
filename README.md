Traffic light optimization using sumo.

# Traffic Light Optimization using Deep-RL
In this project, we study and implemetent traffic light optimaization techniques uisng a Deep-Reinforcment Learning Benchmarking tool, FLOW:
FLOW was developed by the Mobile Sensing Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley with the goal of providing structured and scalable RL optimization tools in traffic management for autonmous vehicles and traffic lights. https://flow-project.github.io/

# Installation
In order to begin implementing the code, the user needs to install flow in their home directory. Please follow the instructions provided in https://github.com/flow-project/flow to install and begin using FLOW.
The intructions will guide the user to install SUMO and rllib which aren important pieces of the project too.
